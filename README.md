## Kaggle - The Home of Data Science & Machine Learning
*https://www.kaggle.com/*

**The goal of this repository is to get more experience in process of data analysis: collection, processing, cleaning, plotting, feature engineering, etc. Also would be nice to improve my R and Python skills as well as become more comfortable with mostly used machine learning algorithms. In Kaggle competitions I'm going to replicate works of others and try out my own ideas.**

# [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic#description)
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. In this challenge, the goal is to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive and apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
