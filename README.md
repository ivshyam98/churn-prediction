**The goal of this repository is to get more experience in process of data analysis: collection, preprocessing, cleaning, plotting, feature engineering, etc. Also would be nice to improve my R and Python skills as well as become more comfortable with mostly used machine learning algorithms. Here I'm going to replicate works of others and try out my own ideas.**

*The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this challenge, the goal is to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive and apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.*
