# Kaggle
###### The Home of Data Science & Machine Learning

The goal of this repository is to get more experience in process of data analysis: collection, processing, cleaning, plotting, feature engineering, etc. Also would be nice to improve my R and Python skills as well as become more comfortable with mostly used machine learning algorithms. Here I'm going to replicate other works and try out my own ideas.
